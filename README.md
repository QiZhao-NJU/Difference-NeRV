# DNeRV: Modeling Inherent Dynamics via Difference Neural Representation for Videos (CVPR2023)
This is the official implementation of the paper "DNeRV: Modeling Inherent Dynamics via Difference Neural Representation for Videos".

Our work is modified on "E-NeRV: Expedite Neural Video Representation with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal Context (ECCV 2022)", https://github.com/kyleleey/E-NeRV. Thanks to Zizhang Li for his excellent implementation. We 

Also, DNeRV is inspire on HNeRV
