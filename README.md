# DNeRV: Modeling Inherent Dynamics via Difference Neural Representation for Videos (CVPR2023)
This is the official implementation of the paper "DNeRV: Modeling Inherent Dynamics via Difference Neural Representation for Videos (CVPR2023)".

Our work is modified base on "E-NeRV: Expedite Neural Video Representation with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal Context (ECCV 2022)", https://github.com/kyleleey/E-NeRV. Thanks to Zizhang Li for his excellent implementation. The main structure of the DNeRV is same as E-NeRV.

Also, DNeRV is inspire by "HNeRV: A Hybrid Neural Representation for Videos (CVPR2023)". Instead of content stream proposed by HNeRV, we add the difference stream with a difference encoder and a attention module, Collaborative Content Unit (CCU).
